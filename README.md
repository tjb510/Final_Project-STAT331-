# Quantitative Analyisis of Romer's Model of Economic Growth

# Project Overview
Economist Paul Romer introduced a theory of economic growth that emphasizes the role of new “ideas” or technological advancements in driving long-term economic progress. According to Romer, since ideas are non-rival, technological improvements can enhance economic conditions by enabling widespread efficiency gains in production processes. In light of this theory, I aim to explore the relationship between the number of patents in force and its impact on a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Patents serve as legal indicators of new ideas or technological innovations by being pieces of intellectual property, making them a suitable proxy for Romer’s notion of “ideas”. By using GDP as a measure of total economic growth, which quantifies the production of all goods within a country, I expect that an increase in the number of patents in force should correspond with an increase in GDP, lending empirical support to Paul Romer’s theory.

## Results
Key Outcomes of the Project:

### Strong Positive Relationship Between Patents and GDP:
The regression analysis identified a robust and positive linear correlation between the number of patents in force and the estimated GDP. This supports the idea that technological advancements, as measured by patents, are closely associated with economic growth.

### Support for Paul Romer’s Economic Growth Theory:
The findings align with Paul Romer’s theory, which emphasizes the role of technological progress and innovation in driving long-term economic development. The correlation provides preliminary quantitative evidence for this theory.

### Preliminary Analysis of Patent Impact:
The analysis provided preliminary support but fell short of establishing a causal relationship between the number of patents and GDP. Further research is required to explore whether an increase in patents directly causes GDP growth.
